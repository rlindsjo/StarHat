# Star Hat


Star Hat is an Arduino Gemma project making a story telling hat with "stars"

## Features
* Rainbox effect for transitions (startup / shutdown)
* Calm blinking star effect while telling story
* Single button interface

## Implementation
The star hat is built from a "witches" black hat, with a 60 led strip of neolight spiraling through it. The leds are controlled by a Adafruit Gemma with a single button controller, a LiPo battery and a USB charger for the battery.
